Viper keyboard firmware
=========================
Korean custom keyboard designed by Duck.

*Note that this is not the official firmware*


Supported models
----------------
None, so far :(


Build
-----
Move to this directory then just run `make` like:

    $ make


Bootloader
---------
The PCB is hardwired to run the bootloader if the Caps Lock key is held down when connecting the keyboard.

Not sure about this:
It is still possible to use Boot Magic and Command to access the bootloader though.
